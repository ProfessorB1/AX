# AX
An AI that understands tasks and can do basic things and much more.

I am currently building an AI that can understand the things it is being asked as well as being able to multi task, my goal is
for it to be able to track speed and know the altitude it is currently at in case of an emergency.
I will be allowing it to be able to recognize the voice but as well be able to communicate in text and not just talking.

I will be updating until I have completed the ai as well as with the software. 
I am currently creating an Ai named AX that can be used for medical, personal use, give advice, and stock market notifications with indicators. The purse for this ai is mostly medical and it will be very useful for when there is an accident or a car crash, due to having permissions of the GPS, location, physical activity sensors, the altitude, maps, contacts, camera, and phone numbers. How it will work is if it feels like it was something minor it will ask if you're okay if there is no response then it will contact your emergency contact and give the location as well as the altitude. If it was something worse as a car crash or it feels no heart rate, or sudden motions than it will contact 911, give the location, the velocity (if needed), and if you are responsive or not, giving them your heart rate, bp, and state of conditions.
